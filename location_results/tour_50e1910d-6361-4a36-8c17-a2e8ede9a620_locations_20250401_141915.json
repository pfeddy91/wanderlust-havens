      "description": "An archipelago of 365 islands and cays known for its stunning turquoise waters, white-sand beaches, secluded anchorages, and unique wildlife encounters like the swimming pigs and nurse sharks. The description heavily implies staying within this chain, likely at a small resort, private rental, or potentially aboard a boat moving between cays, rather than a single large town."
